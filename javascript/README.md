# Algorithm With JavaScript

## general
1. binarySearch.js: Binary Search in JS.
2. mapWithReduce.js: map function created with reduce method.
3. variance.js: Variance algorithm in JS.
4. combinations: Get all possible combinations from given arr.
5. isPrime.js: dividing through 2 to root n, returns boolean result for number n whether prime or not.
### codewars
1. [jadenCasingStrings.js](https://github.com/ChaeWonKong/algorithmWithJS/blob/master/general/codewars/jadenCasingStrings.js): Make first letter in every words to be upper case.
2. [unique_in_order.js](https://github.com/ChaeWonKong/algorithmWithJS/blob/master/general/codewars/unique_in_order.js): takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.
3. [stringIncrementer.js](https://github.com/ChaeWonKong/algorithmWithJS/blob/master/general/codewars/stringIncrementer.js): Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string. If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1. If the string does not end with a number the number 1 should be appended to the new string.
4. [twoFighters.js](https://github.com/ChaeWonKong/algorithmWithJS/blob/master/general/codewars/twoFighters.js): Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.
5. [complementaryDna.js](https://github.com/ChaeWonKong/algorithmWithJS/blob/master/general/codewars/complementaryDna.js): In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string,); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all.
6. [countingDuplicates.js](https://github.com/ChaeWonKong/algorithmWithJS/blob/master/general/codewars/countingDuplicates.js): Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

## sort
1. mergeSort.js: Sort algorithm that has time complexity of O(lgn). Uses divide and conquer.
